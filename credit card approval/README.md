# Credit Card Approval Project

This project focuses on predicting credit card approvals using machine learning techniques. It includes data cleaning, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Folder Contents

- `cc_approvals.data`: Raw dataset for credit card approvals
- `notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with code, analysis, and results

## Getting Started

1. Open `notebook.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code.
2. Follow the notebook steps to preprocess data, build models, and evaluate results.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas, numpy, scikit-learn (install via pip if needed)

## Usage

Run the notebook to:

- Load and clean the credit card approval dataset
- Build and evaluate machine learning models
- Analyze results and insights
