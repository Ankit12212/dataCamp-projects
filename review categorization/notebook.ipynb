When I use Wunderlist or Google Tasks or just Alexa by itself, the changes are instantly viewable across all platforms. The only reason I downloaded with app was to give me more control over my Alexa lists (which for some insane reason you cannot reorder). The extremely lag in syncing Any.do with Alexa renders this app useless. The UI looks really nice and user friendly, so I bumped it up to 2 stars.",

Da diese Anzeigeweise auch zentraler Part mehrer Projekte war, die ich mit Nicht-Premium-Nutzern teile, stellte ich dem Support des Weiteren die Frage, ob das irgendwann zukünftig geplante Folgefeature auch wieder für Nicht-Premium-Mitglieder verfügbar sein wird. Die Antwort darauf war, dass es egal sei, wenn ich ein Projekt mit einem Nicht-Premium-Kunden teile, da Premiumvorteile immer genutzt werden können, solange man halt eben Premiummitglied ist. Dahingehend also Danke für nichts.  Schade. So gern ich die App auch immer mochte: So kann ich sie nicht mehr benutzen und bei der gezeigten Reaktion des Supports will ich das auch nicht mehr.  ## Edit: ## Die Methode von Doist funktioniert natürlich auch nicht wie gewünscht, nämlich nicht mit Non-Premium-Kunden.

The only good thing that this app has going for it is the clean user interface, and a clever separation of the to-do list into three sections.  It is missing some pretty basic to-do list functionality.  The game loads slowly, and doesn't work without an internet connection.  Some of the bugs I've experienced: Reminders pop up on random days, no matter how many times I readjust their settings. Constantly having trouble connecting to the servers. Visual bugs: shows one item, but you get some other item.  Newly equipped main weapon won't show on avatar until app restarted. Progress bars for quests spaz out every time you open the page.

I checked your most recent reviews and a few others seem to have the same problem. Please, please, please fix this. I will say as well that the first opening of the game feels a little jarring. The editing of ones character feels clumsy and it is definitely not better to start with a randomized character. Give users a blank sheet and let THEM apply changes.",

It won't even give me my password! I tried resetting it several times. How annoying, bad design. After I spent so much time on the app too, all for it not to work",

In the avatar creation, I had to keep pressing the options I wanted over and over for it to actually work, then when I finished the avatar had options I didn't pick. Every habit defaults to being both positive and negative. I know there has to be some default, but it's kind of weird that if I have a positive habit I have to tap the negative button. Adding tags is really clunky because the tags have to be added to the filter, (I guess it works but it's unintuitive to have to add a tag to the filter instead of just tagging the task itself) but when I add them they don't immediately get added. They disappear and then get added a few minutes later. Half the time it won't let me move around the tasks. Sometimes the FAQ text pops up overlaying whatever screen I'm on. Switching between habits, dailies, to-dos, and rewards is finicky. Sometimes swiping doesn't work, sometimes trading the icon doesn't work. I have to tap things in the equipment menu multiple times for them to work. Same for the avatar menu.

Habitica used to be an amazing app. I need it for all of my dailies and to-dos, but ever since the code was migrated, the app has been nigh unusable. At the moment I can't even login. When I finally manage to, my dailies and to-dos don't show up. It's a struggle to mark a daily as completed because it takes forever for the server to recognize that I tapped on the daily. Overall, this app needs to be reworked. I really hope things can be fixed because I want to keep using this app. Otherwise I'll have to find something else.",
          "Fix the thing (idk is that a bug of anything else), I hardly click the \"next\" button (or text). And its look like nothing's loading, makes me wait and think \"is it loading or not?\" then I restart the app but it became worse, my character not loaded, and the button became harder to click 😑",

If these get fixed, I'll edit and bump up the rating.",

          "Habitica is great on browser, and indeed has helped me tons to manage my routines, but the app itself doesn't function properly. Now I can't even scroll down the pages to pick dailies that are further down, or habits, sometimes a newly hatched pet won't appear, and neither will food, and it doesn't tell how much damage I'm doing to a boss. And the browser version has some bugs too, sometimes logging in it will display in Pt DESPITE being set to English (I assume it's my browser's settings, but the page's options SHOULD prevail over), and synching will sometimes take gold, health or mana away randomly. Still kicks the app's ass in every way.",

[Update] The app is still horrible but I've stuck to it because of the mechanics. I've been keeping up with my habits but I really wish they'd fixed the mobile app!",

          "I used to swear by Habitica for a long time, but frankly I find it almost unusable. The biggest, most important problem is the way sync works. You can't use Habitica if offline (or have bad internet connection), you can't click several buttons in quick succession, and you are never sure if clicking a button actually sends data to server, Android widgets are absolutely unusable. Habitica's manual frames it as if it's not their, but user's fault.  I have more than a dozen of Habits and about the same amount of Dailies, most of which are themselves checklists. I keep track of multiple habits, therefore I open Habitica and press + and - many times a day, sometimes several times in an hour. If every time I try to register a Habit or a Daily I must worry about Habitica not syncing properly, then it robs me of time and mental energy. Which makes it useless for actually instilling habits.",
          "The UX is horribly clunky and it takes more than two clicks just to do anything. Coming from Todoist to this is like a bird flying into tar pit! All the habit and time management improving features are sort of stuck behind the horrible UI. Why do I need to see soooo many boxes and options when I just want to and a single to-do. Further more, why does it take 2 taps just to get to that screen in the first place?! If I'm on the Todo tab, I probably want to add a to-do. I honestly haven't seen an app this bad in years.",

          "I was excited to use this app and love the categories and reward system for habits, dailies, to-do. After a few days and several rookie mistakes that aren't explained well in the tutorial, I realized this app is way too heavy on the game mechanics for my use. I want to have a list of dailies to partially complete everyday, to encourage reading and writing every now and then, not everyday. This app punishes you for not checking these things off everyday. I totally didn't realize my character was losing tons of health until it hit the red zone. I then started reading up on the death mechanic and am very turned off. I can understand wanting to give the players consequences for missing a task, but it shouldn't be health loss and it should account for how the player uses the dailies (must complete everyday or bonus if completed). They also do not make it easy to provide feedback. All the discussion links either required creating a separate account (different from the habatica account) or were closed threads. This app could be so fun but I feel it loses sight of promoting good habits/organization. I love gaming, but this is super heavy handed mechanics to me. Would keep using this app if I could keep the lists alone.",

So this app had to be good, because your habits are a private and important thing. And it's absolutely not good. The last (but not only) straw was when parts of a menu are rendering in completely the wrong place, and won't clear. Inviting people to your party was way too confusing, until I found out it didn't even work until I did it manually *on the site*. There's more, but I won't bother. I know its supposed to be open source but is ANY testing happening? I was trying to be an advocate for this and you guys just killed it for me with this bad app.",

The website can't seem to log me in and if I click on any of the links on the FAQ page, it takes me back to the homepage. Also, tasks are listed in the order which I put them and not in the order that they expire.. so I have to check each task for the date and time of expiry. Not only that, the dates are displayed weirdly.. some have dd/mm/yy format while others have mm/dd/yy. Developers have much work to do.",

This concept is amazing, and the idea is just brilliant. However, this is by far the buggiest app I've ever had on my Android, and the UI is just not well thought of. Guys, please work on the bugs so I won't have to click 1,000 times before I get feedback that something happened, won't have to reopen the app and lose all the initial welcome tour with all the choices, won't have to use my full name without being able to change it because I signed up with Google.... These things seem basic to me. I really hope it will get better, this app could be a life changer!",

          "It's a very bad app because I changed the settings too , but the tree 🌲 would die everytime if I opened another app or turned off my phone",

The response team said they were on vacation until 5 October so I was patient with them. It is already 10 October and I already asked for multiple follow ups, and still no resolution (redeem or just reimburse me) of my problem. How long does it take for you to fix this. I've paid actual money for this. I love the app but response 👎",

          "I used to like this app and have motivation to actually use it, collect coins and buy new species of trees. But now all the cool stuff is only available in the paid version. Disappointed. Upd: stop with this pirated software BS. You did it because you're greedy little devs. Unfortunately, you will only lose customers instead of making money through ads. How sad",

I understand that everything CAN'T be for free BUT the numerous advertisements which I watched since last 2 years didn't generate any revenue? The trees which I bought with my coins went all into the premium version and now they are saying that I can't plant them until I upgrade. What the poppycock is this?! Without much ado, let me move on and get a new productive app.",

          "It doesn't work anymore:(",
          "the new update locked several of the trees behind a paywall. this is disgraceful because all users should be able to unlock them by using the app. there is no justification for taking away important parts of the app that were previously available to everyone and now only premium users can access them. the devs must change this back so that all previously released trees can be unlocked by anyone. edit: there are many other reviews with the same problem but the devs don't care. LISTEN TO THE USERS",
          "Used to love this app, but I got a new phone (Pixel 4a) and its all screwed up now. It won't let me restore my purchases and the buttons are misaligned so the back button is hidden under the camera. I get stuck and have to close the app to exit the screen. Really disappointing.",
          "it is extremely disappointing that most of the trees now fall under the pro version and the developer is basically forcing the free users to buy the pro version and pay money,, and it's not like I didn't contribute to this application's revenue since I've watched thousands of advertisements over the past few years so this new update is really frustrating. what's the point of allowing people to download it for free if you are just going to restrict it so much and take away so many features?",
          "I already bought this app a year ago. I just got a new phone and it keeps on pushing me to buy premium when I've already bought it. Logging will also push you to buy the premium. I've tried to click Forget Password but it send the email VERY LATE.",

          "It used to be great but ever since it updated it doesn't work and it let's me go onto other apps while in use which defeats the purpose of the app. I was going to upgrade to premium but now that its not working I don't dare risk it if even the basic features don't work then I doubt that the premium ones will.",
          "This is the worst app ever. My password was breached and my information may have been leaked to third parties. It won't let me delete my account or even change my password. You should be ashamed that you made an app that takes people's information like this, and then you don't have the courtesy to give them the option to delete their account. Literally the worst. Get yourselves sorted.",
          "For a producticity app they sure are unproductive. I sent them messages regarding some glitches in my app. Four months later, no follow-ups, no solutions.",

          "Hearing other peoples experiences really ruins the app for me. I'm a pro user, I didn't know that all the trees were behind a pay wall now. But to make that change, it's really disappointing. It takes away all the fun, all the hard work people have made to buy trees. And you guys don't care, you just copy and paste the same trashy response. I honestly don't think that putting everything behind a pay wall will \"prevent pirated software\".

Ive unlocked every tree, have 16k+ coins & feel betrayed by this new referral nonsense. Get help.",

Unfortunately from the September update on almost all trees are behind a pay wall now. I understand you cannot do everything for free, but the trees should at least be available for coins you can earn for using this app. I'm not sure if you are really reading this, but you don't have to copy and paste your standard answer to my comment as well. You already did it to a bunch of others.",
          "It's a bit pathetic that rather than adding new features to encourage people to switch to a paid version, features have been removed to make the free version less appealing. The number of trees available to purchase no matter how many ads you watch is now nothing compared to the past.",

          "This program has gotten worse by updating. This is not acceptable",
          "No real objective, I dont see the difference from a simple timer. The app is still good, but you can't really look at your forest and say \"wow\" and get motivated. I think this app doesnt keep its promises :) Also I have no sound so I dont know when the timer goes off which does not do the job (it works for others people tho).",

          "This app has big issues. It allows other apps to be used even though they have been restricted from use during a tree planting. This is despite blocking those apps in the allow list It kept crushing so I uninstalled it and put it back on. All my progress from when I started planting trees was lost and I use a pro version. One should be able to recover those planted trees surely. After all I'm using the pro version .",
          "Used to like this app alot but now I have less motivation in earning coins since I have to get premium to get the trees i want. 😔 Saw the developer's reply in others' alike review but I hope they make an effort to create trees that compensate the update.",

          "I don't mind giving pro users some advantages but this is too much! way too many tree species need to be unlocked with money now, and I looked forward to unlocking them! I was even thinking of buying the premium but after this update I don't want to anymore. Very dissapointed",

I had an entire plan for which trees I still wanted to get and the newest species looks awesome! But now I have to PAY to unlock it? The little trees were my number 1 motivation to use this app and get my work done in the first place... now I can't even do that.",

But now you have omitted all of the interesting species for free version and it is not enjoyable for me any more. I live in Iran so I can not purchase the pro version and I am pretty sure I'm not alone in this. I hope you find away to get back everything to normal cause I am definitly in love with this app.",
          "I really liked it at first and one of the main reasons that attract me was. The beautiful trees and now free users can only have limited trees and I don't even like one of them so I'm removing this from my favourite app list. Time to find another one. I'm really disappointed...",
          "It take to much time",
          "I was genuinely considering buying the pro version because I really liked this app but the latest update made a bunch of the trees premium only and I had just saved enough coins to buy another and now I can't get one of the ones I wanted and I'm very angry so now I don't want to anymore.",
          "This app has definitely helped me put my phone down, but you peak fairly quickly in the unpaid version and run out of rewards. After using it for six months, I've run out of trees and plants to purchase, so there's not much more to \"add\" to the experience in terms of utilizing my coins. When I get a new phone I wasn't able to transfer my account and discovered that the unpaid version has even fewer options available than before.",
          "Helps me focus greatly but I cant connect to my other devices. I bought the app with my iPad but I cant log in through my android phone to access any of the data or my trees",

Now, those trees are locked behind a \"premium\" wall... they're charging you for content they offered for free before. It seems like they're taking advantage of their users and charging money for an app catered towards helping broke college students study. Seems wrong, especially during such hard economic and social times. I'm a long time user offering 2 stars.",
          "Used to be a good app. Now it is limited. Students don't have that much to pay for every app they use.",
          "Nothing interesting unless you get premium 😕 at least let us buy trees by watching some ads",
          "time to find another app........ the pro version is really good and i understand it is needed to provide good services, but there are plenty of other versions rather than making only 10 trees available for free version users. put more adds, add in-app purchase to purchase like coins or an upgraded coins like every game app do, make special tree more expensive in coins... this update really kills the appeal of this app.",
          "I'm writing this review while my tree is growing. I can't turn on the android focus mode, but facebook works fine, so what is the point of this app? I've enabled all the permissions, but it doesn't block chrome or facebook.",
          "Used to love the app. They make you give phone access to be in leader boards and buy premium for interesting trees. I understand they are worried about pirated software but they are sacrificing their user base in exchange.",
          "App is very useful but most fun part - planting trees is annoying. There are very few species available. Even though I bought premium I still need to \"focus\" approximately 4000 minutes just to buy 1 2k tree Another feature I would like to have is arranging my forest as I want. Currently trees appear randomly.",
          "I have been using Forest for a few years now and I have switched to an iPhone 11 now but they are asking me to purchase the app to access it. The app is free on android so should I pay for AppleStore?",
          "App is really good at a time. But after the last few updates you made everything premium. We can't even buy new tree species that looks good. That's boreing to plant same kinda trees everyday . Then what can we do with in game money if we can't buy any of them. What are you trying to do. You will loose too many of users by doing these kinda things. So please do something with this stuff please........ Its a request please reply if you agree..",
          "1) If I want to be in leaderboard, I need to give the app permission to all of my private things. No thanks. 2) The achievements always show there's a new achievement unlocked, but there's actually none. This bug is often fixed and then reappears, which is annoying. Otherwise the app is alright. Lots of bugs but they get fixed fast. The part I hate most is the privacy issue because I used to be encouraged by the leaderboard, but I'm not going to give an app such access. Sad. I miss the feature.",
          "It keeps closing the app.",
          "I enable those options, but when I close the program completely, I can still enter other programs. Please help",
          "I loved it. Great concept, but I need a calendar and planner too.",
          "It's a good application overall but... The thing which I remember came with an update the trees you can not plant all of them, thats the reason why I am giving two stars trees make it more interesting and what made the application with pay to plant is bad.",
          "Love it but had to leave a review bcz of the policy so that I can get that lovely free plant",
          "So far good, it would be really good if the developers added a pause function to the app so that if something comes up during your study or focus period, you can easily pause and come back to where you left of. As the time is just going when other things come into focus.",
          "What is 599 error??? It just stop me using this app!! Hate that!",
          "It seems your pro app for most android user has error: 600 when they use referral codes for friend invitation. I hope you fix it as soon as you can.",
          "Hi even when the deep focus mode is on I am still able to go to different apps, and at same time my trees are also growing..!! I saw a youtube video od 20 minites and meanwhile.my 15 minute grew completely. I am 100 sure that deep focus mode was on, as it told me in the app. U should check on that..",
          "feelings disappointed bcs i paid for nothing. you should've let the premium user get at least 5 or more new trees. it was such a large amount of money just for a tree and some little feature.",
          "This app used to be the app I rely on everyday to focus on my studies but after the recent update, users are literally forced to upgrade to premium to unlock a variety of tress. I understand that the organisation needs some sort of income but still, to make most (80%)of the trees unavailable to free users, I am utterly disappointed.",
          "Reducing my rating because after their new update, you cannot unlock most of the trees unless you upgrade to premium. Really affects the experience",
          "Entiendo que todos debemos ganar dinero y que tal vez la situación no está fácil para nadie. Sin embargo, se podrían poner más anuncios y dejar más opciones de diferentes árboles para quienes no somos premium; lo emocionante de la app consistía en concentrarse más seguido para ganar monedas y así comprar el árbol para el que ahorrarás. Ahora, con las limitaciones, ya lo es emocionante... Igual es muy funcional pero era mejor. En todo caso, es entendible y respetable las nuevas actualizaciones.",
          "This app was good, until I purchased the Pro Version. I was saving up coins to buy a 2k tree. When I was finally able to buy it, the system keeps on saying that I did not have enough coins. I tried buying a 600 coin tree and suddenly, my coin went down to 500. From 2k to 500, and I only bought a 600 coin tree. It happened twice already, and this is frustrating.",
          "The most inconvenience I have faced is that the notification sound is not even audible after the tree has completely planted. This make me even more distracted to keep checking on this. Hope forest will take this issue into serious consideration as I was so disappointed by this bug after I have purchased the pro version.",
          "pay money for tree 🌲 :(",
          "I really enjoyed using this app until the September update forced all free users behind a paywall with just a few basic options. In consideration of the pandemic and many folks enjoy the simplicity of this focus app while getting a handle on their own lives, I disagree with the decision of this move. I am not sure what to do with the coins earned since I have all the basic options.",

          "Cant log in after an uninstall. When i press log in i get a pro pop up. But i already have pro. Just let me log in!!!!! Furthermore it just gives me an error when i try to restore purchase. Incredibly disappointed. Loved the app but now i feel robbed. Please fix",
          "Had this app for about 2 years. I had earned almost 5000 points. I got a new phone and everything I had is gone. I have the same number and my email addresses are all synced.. but none of my earnings or unlocks are here.. I feel sort of reluctant to use it now.",

          "Its good",
          "Until recent update it was a 5 star. If you bring changes make sure your customer services are reponsive too at that time. The friendship redeem option didnt appear in settings after update, so i reinstalled same device,now i cant restore at all, \"error says sign out of other accounts\" i use only one email and i will not factory reset my phone for one app. Dont go blind over money, I really want to help plant trees, now everything looks like money grab.",
          "I use the app for years, on my iphone and laptop and I love everything about it. However, I purchased a tablet lately, I downloaded forest and when I try to log in, there's nothing but the pro-version ad. Sadly I can't use my account.",

          "Looks cool but i had to uninstall the app because it wont go to sd storage.",
          "I wanted to like it, but many dealbreakers. No alarm at end of session. No way to automatically go between breaks and work sessions, no way to automatically alternate between short and long breaks, no way to customize alarms that signify end of session. Contacted premium support re: no alarm- no response. Also- when you enter your birthday to register for premium, it's in a calendar form- it's much easier to enter a birthday by typing mm/dd/yyyy or to use a drag down menu for m, d, and year.",
          "So disappointed. I love this app and it's made my study life so much better. I used to recommend it to everyone. Just when i save up enough coins to buy the maple tree i want, i go to the store and the app has updated, making 90% of all the trees except plain GRASS offered only for premium subscription. Super disappointing because i love the app but I'm not paying $3 just to get a virtual maple tree smh",
          "Stupid premium, upgraded version for planting trees 🌳. Not fair 😑",
          "The new update was ridiculous. I have tried so hard to get enough money for my favorite trees but they had been moved to pro version. As no more motivation I have, I uninstall this app",

          "Okay",

          "I live in Iran.I can't use the app because of payment problems. 😑😒 I have to uninstall it.",
          "The new update is worse. I used to love it but the new interface is not at all good. Almost 60% of the trees are now in the pro version, which leave almost nothing for the non pro version users. And the trees look very small which selection in the new layout. Previously it was good. I hope all these shall be rectified in the later versions",
          "The new update is really disappointing. I was truly enjoying the app and watching my forest grow.",
          "I like the concept and have found a lot of utility out of the free version. I bought the pro version for 1.99 to show gratitude, but now I can't double the amount of in game currency I earn by watching an ad. You use the in game currency to buy different types of plants, and with pro, most plants are almost 10x the price. So with pro, you earn 50% in game currency and need 10x to buy most plants. That's 20x the time. Seems like a shameless way to try and hawk micro purchases of in game currency",
          "This used to be such a great app... But since the new update we cannot purchase new species of trees... Additional to that the promotional adds have increased. The iOS users aren't paying a single penny extra for anything either pro version or having a group timer even all the species are available. This is not done... You have snatched the mere basic content of the app from Android users.",
          "La aplicación no da ninguna notificación posterior al tiempo que seleccione por lo que no sé realmente cuanto tiempo he estado estudiando ni sé manejar mis tiempos de descanso. Ya realice los pasos sugeridos por la aplicación y aún así no me notifica nada. Mi celular es Huawei, no sé si esa sea la razón.",
          "I love this app and would have happily given it five stars or more, but all the trees ive unlocked were relocked and im very unhappy. Ive always had the pro version, i should have my trees.",

          "I now have a strong dislike for this app. I've had it for a little while now but the fact that I now have to pay for pro for most of the trees is ridiculous. It was fine before. Why do these app developers mess things up like this?",
          "Guys what the hell is pro version.. I collected coins to buy the 2k tree but now I can't 😒m giving u two stars cz I aced in my exam cz of this app.. But the pro version is really disappointing..😢",

          "Edit: I've had his app for a long time. I was here back when the app whitelist was a free feature. In the latest update the free version is much more limited and free users can't even buy all the trees anymore. It's frustrating to see all the good features of this app being hidden away. I understand new updates like the detailed stats and planting with friends being exclusive to the pro version or making newer trees exclusive but please give the old trees back!",
          "I would like to see different colours of trees depending on what their tag is (eg. study, rest, entertainment etc.) so that I know how exactly I spent my time with just one look.",
          "Incredibly disappointed with the new update. This app used to be visually pleasing because of the vast variety of trees, but now you have to pay for every good aspect of this app. While I understand the developers need (and deserve) money, there is a limit.",
          "basically if you don't have the pro version you can't use 90% of the app such a good app but you have to pay for each and every new options for studying like pie chart trackers 😒no good",
          "This app is really very good ....but I'm disappointed with the new update.... majority of the tress have been added to the pro version ...I happily updated to see if any new species is added ... I recommended it to many of my friends .... but I'm seriously very disappointed",
          "I realy like this app. Rhe thing is that you only can buy some specific trees and for the others you need the pro version and befor you just can buy more trees.",
          "this app has become more and more money driven. as someone who has been using this for years and across multiple devices, this is really disappointing. more and more features that used to be free are being locked behind a paywall. hopefully someone comes out with a similar app because the concept is good but now everyth needs to be paid for.",
          "Sad that the feature of being able to pick which apps can be blocked are for the pro version only :( as well as many of the other tree species :(( i've saved up some coins to be able to buy one of the more expensive ones but now i won't be able to unless i buy pro which is a shame :( what species left for the free version is also very few now :(( not as fun to use this app now, but i guess i understand the need for money.",
          "I loved this app and there was so much to look forward to, until i got limited to 7 trees and everything that actually getting me excited to work harder just got locked. I can understand the reason for making the pro version better but I dont see why u had to make the free version borderline useless to do that.",
          "It say over 25 mil downloads and there are only 10 mil downloads",
          "They just had to lock away half of the unlockable trees. It was hard earning coins day by day hoping one day to unlock all trees. Frequently, I'd watch ads to double the coins I'll earn. But now since they locked them up for good. I guess this coins of mine are only good for deleting my record for dying trees.",
          "I hate how I now have to get the Pro version to plant the trees that I like. Maybe give more trees in the free version or give more veriety? The nine free ones don't really give me motivation to finish anything.",
          "Who would want to continue using the app for free with such limited trees? I guess this app isn't student friendly, such a shame. It was really a big help to me, it's sad to finally uninstall after a long time of use.",
          "The ads don't always give you double coins bc there are some you can't close and they just loop when they're done, so the only thing you can do is close the app and then you don't get double coins. Edit: bug is mostly fixed. The way to opt out of the second ad now appears after ~5 seconds. Unfortunately the update locked most of the unlockable tree species behind a paywall so the app just got a whole lot less interesting for me :/",
          "Quite disappointed after the recent updates... You are trying to monetize everything... You may end up loosing your worthy and loyal customers by this predatory approach...",
          "What motivated me to keep using the app was collecting coins to unlock different trees. Now, to unlock must of them, is not enough to collect coins... now you have to have the \"pro\" version! I was earning to get the sunflowers... Why? WHY!? I'll have to found another app. Also, I don't think it's ok to only plant trees in real life only having the pro version :( use ecosia browser instead (not sponsored) and stop monopolizing our planet's health.",

          "He ha",
          "I used to love working with this aoo and it was helpful. But the recent update is frustrating. It sounds vast inequality among your paid and unpaid users. And it seems foolish to paid only for some species while you can get other effective apps for free. Mu aim is to upgrade my focus, not to buy trees. So really upset for this unfriendly update and yes, uninstalling it.",
          "I am really unhappy 😞 with this app now .....I was working hard to buy a new tree and now you have converted all into pro version..... Irrespective of thinking of people who can't afford🙁",
          "It's a good app to block your phone if you want to focus for some time. The thing is, it is not as good if what you want is to stop over-using your phone altogether. Also the last change of moving certain tree species (most of them, almost all) to premium is kind of lame, since so many functions are already only available for premium accounts. Couple that with how much time it takes to get a tree and this change seems unnecessary (since use time also means more adds watched and more revenue).",
          "The last updated is so bad 😔 i used to use forest about 2y and now i uninstall it im so sad cuz its been like my friend and do help me alot in terms of studying i cant buy the pro version bye bye forest 💔",

          "I used to love this app. Unfortunately, the new update took away the features I liked the most unless you pay for premium (used to be free!). The app white list is now premium only, as are many of the trees I used to have before getting a new phone. Very disappointed, will need to find a new app",

As a collage student who uses a time-table app, this sounded really useful! But then I found out that this feature is locked behind a paywall. Every other prenium feature is fine as prenium, but I cannot get behind this one being locked. I'll have to find another app.",

Our firewall detected (and blocked) hundreds of attempts to servers in China when the app was sitting open but idle.

Since I paid for the app I would expect these to be available. Will change stars if resolved. It's dissapointing because this is one of the best habit tracking app, but the lack of sync and export/inport function is a deal breaker. ((UPDATE (March 2015): What happened to the option to switch between the weekly and monthly view?!! It was very useful.)) I tried a number of other apps for habit tracking and this one is the best so far. Very clean and easy to navigate interface, useful statistics and clear feedback on both the streak and the overall trend and percentage. I love the easy way to switch between weekly and monthly view. One suggestion would be to include a colored bar for each habit where the colors are based on the daily success and failures. I saw this in one of the better iphone habit apps. I actually used Habit Streak Pro for years and I did see HabitBul earlier, but the bull icon deterred me from trying it because I thought it looked really cheesy. The app behind this cheesy icon is actually the best of the habit trackers I have tried so far. Keep up the good job.",

This is overly cumbersome over time and is going to cause me to stop using the app because I don't want to have to check everything that DIDN'T happen. This could be much better if it assumes I didn't drink or smoke if I didn't make any mark for that day. Or at least give me the option to do it this way.",

It would also be cool to see a health bar that represents the amount of time you have in a day to be productive.

They have to keep checking ToDo all during the day wasting time. 2. We lost the crucial COMMENTS section. This allowed a team member to provide a status update or send a query. This had a date and time stamp which gave a history that helped to determine the pace of work on the task. It allowed the team leader to communicate easily and give feedback.

The reminder function needs to be able to repeat itself multiple times in a day. When certain events are coming up, I want to be reminded 24 hours, 1 hour, and 5 minutes before to the event.  The reminder function also needs an option to decide the duration of the sound and vibration.

Any app that displays weird looking adds (ads for games?!) that cover the whole screen are suspicious apps: spyware, etc. You should count yourself lucky that I did not report your app to Google. The only reason for not doing that is that I've been using your app for some time, before the new ad behavior, and it was fine. 2.

Really, if I'm a business person what would I want with an online game for children? 3. You mentioned the apps has to be deployed daily. Tough luck! I did not make your release schedule, you did.

I set my Tuesday task to repeat every Thursday from completion date and checked it off on a Sunday. The app should have rescheduled the task for the following Sunday, but it didn't.

I bought the pro version a while ago when it was a single payment purchase, but now apparently I no longer can use it and it's a yearly subscription.

Not that it's that expensive, but one it's a yearly payment, and two, who's going to pay for anything they aren't sure will work just right? Not me...   Developers, I'm being extra generous and giving you two stars, because it's a good app behind the payment and it's only $5 a year. But for real? Recurring events? I should not have to pay for that.

If you close the app again, you get asked for your passcode --NOT your passWORD. But your passcode doesn't work anymore, that time.

The only feature that might set it apart from the competition is the project feature, but you have to pay to use it. Sure, you have the notes feature, but there are ways to accomplish the same thing in pretty much any other calendar, so I just can't see the point. Rather than pay for an upgrade to an app that's just ho-hum (the view isn't even very customizable), I'll be uninstalling.",

I did email for answers but no one will answer my questions. My questions are not bad for this app but the people behind this app are terrible business people. So this could be a great app but service is terrible.

After only one day of using the app, I have encountered the following:  1. From calendar screen, + button does not give option for Project (only Event, Task, or Note).  I have the upgraded version.  2. Settings, General, Start with... is set for Day View, but shows month instead.  3. Help & Feedback only gives option to email for help. No option to search for help.  4. When deleting an item in a series comma I do not get the option to just delete the one occurrence.  Am I doing something wrong? Is there any help that I can expect to receive? I paid $4.99 for the upgraded version, and I am not at all happy. Busy people with crazy schedules need a reliable app.",

Text overlap and the fact that the only screen orientation available is landscape immediately turned me off to the app. The layout is not bad and puts all the information right in front of you but it looks as if it was built for Windows 98. I certainly was not willing to pay for the full version when the free version was so flawed. I can find better free apps with more functionality than the paid version of this one. It needs some work.",

The glitch was that when adding something to the calendar a box would come up for date/time but cut off the calendar and clock that's necessary to select date/time. There was no way to even input manually. It would work great if you only had to enter something for whichever date you were on and a specific one hour period set a half an hour after the time on your device. Very disappointing.",

So I paid for the pro version to get more out of it. Nothing has changes, I go to landscape view and it won't scroll. It's glitch to. I have paid the $4.99 and it keeps telling me to upgrade. I've already paid!!! I emailed you guys and still haven't heard any support a week later. So my advice to you all, keep your $5.",

No downloads available on their site, site is very sparse and lacking real support info.
